My Functionally Dysfunctional Project For Coding With Lewis Hackathon

## Getting Started
- To use this project you will need to:
  1. Clone the repository
  2. Activate the Python Environment `./env/Scrips/activate` for Windows
  3. Install dependencies (if they arent installed already)
  4. Start the Flask backend `python app.py`
  5. Host the html page (I used live server)
- Enjoy!!!
